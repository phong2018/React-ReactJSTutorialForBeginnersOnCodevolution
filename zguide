$27: Memo: like PureComponent but use for function
--------
$26: PureComponent
- if there is no different, the component is not re-render. 
- A pure component on the orther hand implement shouldComponentUpdate with a shallow props and state comparison
- shallow comparison
+ primative Types: return true if: same value && type
+ complex type: return true if: reference the exact same object
ex: 
var a=[1,2];
var b=[1,2];
var c=a;
=> a===b //false
=> a===c //true (same object)

$25: Fragments

$24: Updating lifecycle method
- static getDirivedStateFromProps: called every time a component is rendered
- shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps,nextState): 
- render
- getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(preProps,preState): called right before the changes from the virtual DOM are are to be reflected in the DOM
- componentDidUpdate(preProps,preState,snapshot): called after the render is finished in the re-render cycles
--------
$23:Component Mouting lifecycle methods
+ constructor: 
+ static getDirivedStateFromProps
+ render: 
+ componentDidMount: interact with the DOM, ajax calls to load data
--------
$22: component lifecycle Method
- mouting: when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM: (4) constructor, static getDirivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount
- upateting: when a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state: (5) static getDirivedStateFromProps, shouldComponentUpdate, render, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, compoentDidUpdate
- unmouting: (1) when a component is being removed from the DOM: componentWillUnmount
- error handling: when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component: (2) static getDirivedStateFromError, componentDidCatch.
--------
$21: Controlled component
--------
$20: Styling React component
- css stylesheets
- inline Styling
- css modules
- css in js libaries (styled compenents)
--------
$19: Index as key anti-pattern 
--------
$17: List rendering
- when update will re-render childs 
+ react is going to compare pre-Key & curr-Key if there different will re-render. If no, NOT re-render.
-> avoid use index in .map() to use key for list childs
--------
$16: Condition rendering
UserGreeting.js
--------
$15: Method as props
--------
$14: Binding event handler
- different: function and function call
+ function is variable
+ function call is implement function
- arrow function is functon (is variable)
--------
$11: setState
- setState(updater, [callback])
--------
$08: JSX
- React.createElement(component, props, ...children)
